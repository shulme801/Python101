# Python101
Teaching myself Python, using Imtiaz Ahmad's excellent "The Complete Python Developer Certification Course", from Udemy.  Imtiaz' approach uses data structures and other Computer Science concepts to elucidate python.  

I've also used "Python Crash Course" -- the book -- but I find it more helpful to work through the courseware that Imtiaz has put together.
